# Battleships

A Python-based version of the boardgame Battleships, along with simulations of various playstyles - including the optimum "probabilistic guessing" strategy.

Written in Python to teach myself the syntax whilst first learning the language.

## Usage
#### Play a manual game:
Run `play.py`, then follow the prompts.

#### Automate a game using various strategies:
* Random guessing: `random_guessing.py`
* 'Search-target' guessing: `search_guessing.py`
* Probabilistic guessing: `probabilistic_guessing.py`

#### Simulate many games to analyse strategy performance:
Run `simulate.py`, then follow the prompts.
Allows for logging raw output to .csv file `battleships_CSV.csv`
